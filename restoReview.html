                Everything was good. Staff was hospitable and quick to attend to you. I ordered all my favorite Filipino dishes and they did not disappoint. 
                Love the mango with shrimp paste for appetizer. Restaurant is inside a mall. Very clean. I recommend this restaurant.

                This restaurant is located at the tail end of Newport Boulevard. There are plenty of places you can walk to but I'm glad we stumbled upon this one. 
                I'm a sucker for interior design and the pictures don't do it justice. Props to whoever designed this restaurant. We went there for lunch and there 
                was no line. Although the place was full, we got our food in no more than 15 minutes. The food itself was delicious. No complaints at all.

                Great food, atmosphere and service. There's nothing to complain about. My favorite item were the fish balls and cheesy corn. 
                The crispy pata were also delicious. The staff was friendly and quick to attend to you.
